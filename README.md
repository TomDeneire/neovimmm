Every Neovim user knows about the hunt for the perfect plugin. Of course, exploring the plugin ecosystem is a lot of fun, but it can also be a rabbit hole that is not only time-consuming, but sometimes also frustrating. There are so many plugins out there, but how to find the one that is right for you and is tried and tested by the community?

That is why I made [neovimmm](https://tomdeneire.github.io/neovimmm/), a comprehensive index of Neovim-related repositories on GitHub. Sure, you can Google plugins or scour Reddit and other platforms, but what about a dedicated search engine that aggregates as many Neovim repositories as possible and ranks them by stars and forks?

The corpus is built by combining multiple GitHub API search queries (by keyword, repo name, and topic) and deduplicating the results, which bypasses the 1,000-result-per-query API limit. Personal dotfiles and user config repos are filtered out, so the index focuses on plugins, tools, themes, and distributions.

So if you're into Neovim and next time you need a specific plugin, check out [neovimmm](https://tomdeneire.github.io/neovimmm/)! Or maybe you just want to browse the top 100 repos based on stars and forks? And who doesn't like the good old "Feeling lucky?"?

More than enough to make you go ... Neovimmm!
